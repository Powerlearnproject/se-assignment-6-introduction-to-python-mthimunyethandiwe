2. Installing Python:
 On your browser search python.org
Download the latest Python installer (64-bit or ARM64) based on your system architecture.
Run the installer and follow the prompts. Make sure to check the option to add Python to your system PATH during installation.

Verify Python Installation:
Open the Command Prompt by pressing Windows + R, typing cmd, and pressing Enter.
Type python --version and press Enter. If Python is installed, it will display the version number.

4. Python Syntax and Semantics:
 print("Hello, World!")
   Basic Syntax Elements
Function Call: print() is a built-in function that outputs text to the console.
String: "Hello, World!" is a string literal enclosed in double quotes.
Parentheses: Enclose the argument passed to the function.

6. Data Types and Variables:
Integer (int): Represents whole numbers (e.g., 5, -10, 0).
Floating-Point (float): Represents decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14, -2.5).
Complex (complex): Represents complex numbers with a real and imaginary part (e.g., 2 + 3j).
String (str): Represents textual data (e.g., “Hello, World!”).
Bytes (bytes) and Bytearrays (bytearray): Used for storing binary data (e.g., image files).
Boolean (bool): Represents True or False values.(https://www.w3schools.com/)
DEMONSTRATION:
my_integer = 42

my_float = 3.14

my_complex = 2 + 3j

my_string = "Hello, World!"

my_bytes = b"binary data"

my_boolean = True

# Printing the variables
print("Integer:", my_integer)
print("Float:", my_float)
print("Complex:", my_complex)
print("String:", my_string)
print("Bytes:", my_bytes)
print("Boolean:", my_boolean). (https://www.w3schools.com/).


8. Control Structures:
Conditional Statements:
Conditional statements allow you to make decisions in your code based on certain conditions.
The most common type of conditional statement is the if statement.(https://www.w3schools.com/)
an example of an IF statement:
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
print("Program ended")

The IF-ELSE statement provides an alternative block of code to execute when the condition is false.
x = 3
if x == 4:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
    
The IF-ELIF-ELSE statement allows you to check multiple conditions in sequence.
letter = "A"
if letter == "B":
    print("letter is B")
elif letter == "C":
    print("letter is C")
elif letter == "A":
    print("letter is A")
else:
    print("letter isn't A, B, or C")
    LOOP
Loops allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times.
The for loop is commonly used to iterate over elements of a sequence (e.g., lists, strings)

heroes = ['Superman', 'Batman', 'Flash']
for hero in heroes:
    print(hero.upper())


9. Functions in Python:
  
Functions in Python are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They are useful for:
Modularity: Breaking down complex problems.
Reusability: Reducing redundancy by using the same code multiple times.
Maintainability: Making code easier to understand and debug.
Encapsulation: Managing logic in a way that reduces errors.

Sum of Two Arguments
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b
 Calling the Function
 result = add_numbers(5, 3)
print(result)

Function Definition: def add_numbers(a, b): defines a function named add_numbers with parameters a and b.
Function Body: return a + b returns the sum of a and b.
Calling the Function: add_numbers(5, 3) calls the function with 5 and 3 as arguments.
Printing the Result: print(result)

10. Lists and Dictionaries:
  Lists:

Ordered collections, indexed by integers.
Allow duplicate elements.
Mutable (modifiable).
Useful for sequences of items.

Dictionaries:

Unordered collections of key-value pairs.
Indexed by unique keys (immutable types like strings or numbers).
Keys must be unique; values can be duplicated.
Mutable (modifiable).
Useful for associating keys with values.

Explanation
List Operations:

Access an element by index: numbers[0].
Add an element: numbers.append(6).
Remove an element: numbers.remove(3).
Dictionary Operations:

Access a value by key: person['name'].
Add a key-value pair: person['email'] = 'alice@example.com'.
Remove a key-value pair: del person['age']

11. Exception Handling:
 SyntaxError: This exception is raised when the interpreter encounters a syntax error in the code, such as a misspelled keyword, a missing colon, or an unbalanced parenthesis.

TypeError: This exception is raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of the wrong type, such as adding a string to an integer.

NameError: This exception is raised when a variable or function name is not found in the current scope.

IndexError: This exception is raised when an index is out of range for a list, tuple, or other sequence types.

KeyError: This exception is raised when a key is not found in a dictionary.

ValueError: This exception is raised when a function or method is called with an invalid argument or input, such as trying to convert a string to an integer when the string does not 
represent a valid integer.

AttributeError: This exception is raised when an attribute or method is not found on an object, such as trying to access a non-existent attribute of a class instance.

IOError: This exception is raised when an I/O operation, such as reading or writing a file, fails due to an input/output error.

ZeroDivisionError: This exception is raised when an attempt is made to divide a number by zero.

ImportError: This exception is raised when an import statement fails to find or load a module.(https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-exception-handling/)

12. Modules and Packages:
https://www.bing.com/search?q=-+Explain+the+concepts+of+modules+and+packages+in+Python.+How+can+you+import+and+use+a+module+in+your+script%3F+Provide+an+example+using+the+%60math%60+module.&cvid=a272a6993aab4ad69eb91dfedbe43a22&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBCDM4MjRqMGo5qAIIsAIB&FORM=ANAB01&PC=U531
Modules:
A module in Python is a single file containing Python code. It can include functions, variables, classes, and executable statements.
Modules allow you to organize code logically and make it reusable across different programs.
To create a module, simply create a .py file with your code.
Example: Suppose you have a file named my_module.py with a function calculate_square(x):

# my_module.py
def calculate_square(x):
    return x ** 2

Packages:
A package is a collection of related modules organized in a directory hierarchy.
Packages help manage larger projects by grouping related functionality together.
A package must contain an __init__.py file (which can be empty) to be recognized as a package.
Example: Suppose you have a package named my_package with two modules: math_operations.py and geometry.py:
my_package/
├── __init__.py
├── math_operations.py
└── geometry.py

Importing Modules:
To use a module in your script, import it using the import statement.
Example (using the math module):
import math

# Now you can use functions from the math module
print(math.sqrt(25))  # Square root: 5.0


13. File I/O:
Reading from and Writing to Files in Python
In Python, you can use the open() function to handle files. Here's a quick summary:

Reading from a File:

Open the file in read mode ('r').
Use methods like read(), readline(), or readlines() to read content.
Use a with statement to ensure the file is automatically closed after reading.
Writing to a File:

Open the file in write mode ('w') or append mode ('a').
Use methods like write() or writelines() to write content.
Use a with statement to ensure the file is automatically closed after writin


# Script to read content from a file and print it to the console

# File path
file_path = 'example.txt'
# Using 'with' to ensure the file is properly closed after reading
with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)

# Script to write a list of strings to a file

# List of strings to write
lines = [
    "First line of text\n",
    "Second line of text\n",
    "Third line of text\n"
]

# File path
file_path = 'output.txt'

# Using 'with' to ensure the file is properly closed after writing
with open(file_path, 'w') as file:
    file.writelines(lines)

print(f"Written {len(lines)} lines to {file_path}")
